# About

<a href="ResumeKrystianWojcicki.pdf" class="btn">Download Resume</a>

For more than 20 years I contributed to the **design**, implementation and testing
of various complex software systems (mostly in **telecommunication** space).
I also worked on **installation** and **upgrade solutions** for network managing systems from one centralized location (so called one-push-button approach).
Additionally; some part of my career was designated to developing simulated environment for the **Big System Testing** focusing on systems managing devices operating with interfaces such as **CLI/TL1** and FTP/SFTP based on **Telnet/SSH**.
During my carrier I evolved from C-based solutions on HP-UX, to stand alone Java GUI client, to **Java-based Service Oriented Architecture** solutions deployed in containers like **Tomcat** and WebLogic running on Solaris and Linux.

In the last four years I got involved in the design, implementation and automated testing of the network management solution made up of micro-services deployed in **Docker** containers.
